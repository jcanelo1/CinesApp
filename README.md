🎭 Theatre Booking App

A simple Android-based Theatre Booking App built using Android Studio. This project demonstrates consistent mobile app development practices, database integration, and user authentication flow for a ticket booking system.

⸻

📱 Overview

This app was designed to allow users to sign up, log in, and receive notifications related to their account status. It’s an early-stage prototype of a theatre booking system — currently featuring half of the core functionality due to time constraints. Despite being incomplete, it effectively demonstrates the implementation of user management, SQLite database handling, and input validation within an Android environment.

🚀 Features

✅ User Authentication
	•	Functional Sign Up and Login system.
	•	Validation of input fields to ensure all required information is entered.
	•	Login status notifications for successful and failed login attempts.

	•	Toast or alert-style messages to inform users about login results or errors.

💾 SQLite Database Integration
	•	Local data storage for user registration and authentication.
	•	Proper database schema setup and query handling for data persistence.

⚙️ Consistent Development Practices
	•	Code structured for maintainability and scalability.
	•	Use of standard Android Studio conventions and layout practices.

🧩 Technologies Used
	•	Android Studio (Primary IDE)
	•	Java / Kotlin (depending on your codebase)
	•	SQLite Database
	•	XML (for UI design)

🏗️ Current Progress

This app currently includes:
	•	✅ Login and Sign Up pages
	•	✅ SQLite database setup
	•	✅ Validation and notification features

Features not yet implemented (due to time constraints):
	•	⏳ Ticket booking functionality
	•	⏳ Theatre listings and seat selection
	•	⏳ Payment gateway integration
	•	⏳ User profile management

Learning Reflection

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
	•	Android app architecture and UI design.
	•	Database integration using SQLite.
	•	Debugging and implementing user feedback through messages.
	•	Structuring app development in a consistent and maintainable way.

Although incomplete, it demonstrates a solid foundation for extending into a full theatre booking experience.

📅 Future Improvements
	•	Implement seat selection and booking logic.
	•	Add theatre and showtime management.
	•	Introduce a more modern UI (e.g., Material Design).
	•	Enable cloud-based authentication (Firebase).
